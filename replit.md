## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a modern React architecture using functional components with hooks. The frontend is built with Vite as the build tool and bundler for optimal development experience and fast builds. The component structure is organized into:

- **Pages**: Home page showcasing all products and an About page with company information
- **Components**: Reusable UI components including Header, Footer, ProductCard, and WhatsAppButton
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library for consistent design system
- **Routing**: Client-side routing implemented with Wouter for lightweight navigation

The styling approach uses Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming, ensuring consistent design tokens across the application. The design system includes predefined color schemes, typography scales, and spacing utilities.

### Backend Architecture
The application uses Express.js as the web server framework with TypeScript for type safety. The backend follows a modular architecture with:

- **Route Registration**: Centralized route management with API prefix structure
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation for user management
- **Development Server**: Integrated Vite development server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware for consistent API responses

The server is configured for both development and production environments, with automatic static file serving in production builds.

### Data Management
The application uses a simple in-memory storage system for user data, with a well-defined interface that can be easily extended or replaced with persistent storage solutions. Product data is currently managed as static data structures in TypeScript files, making it easy to migrate to a database-driven approach.

State management on the frontend utilizes React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management, providing caching, synchronization, and error handling for API calls. Local component state is managed using React's built-in useState and useContext hooks.

### Database Design
The application includes Drizzle ORM configuration for PostgreSQL integration, indicating preparation for database-driven functionality. The current schema includes a users table with basic authentication fields (username, password) and UUID primary keys. The Drizzle configuration is set up for schema migrations and supports environment-specific database URLs.

### Responsive Design Strategy
The application implements a mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints. The layout adapts seamlessly across device sizes with:
- Collapsible mobile navigation menu
- Responsive product grid layouts that adjust from single-column on mobile to multi-column on desktop
- Optimized typography scales for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements for mobile devices
